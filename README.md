# KickBuy
The project focuses primarily on core application logic â€” including **JWT authentication**, **state management with SignalStore**, and **backend integration**. GUI was not a priority in this project

All data used in the app is mock data provided by [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/).  
**Note:** Functionality is limited due the limitations of mock API.

  
### Example login data:
| Username | Password   |
|----------|------------|
| emilys   | emilyspass |
| noramx   | noramxpass |

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.4.

  

## Development server

  

To start a local development server, run:

  

```bash

ng  serve

```

  

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

  

## Code scaffolding

  

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

  

```bash

ng  generate  component  component-name

```

  

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

  

```bash

ng  generate  --help

```

  

## Building

  

To build the project run:

  

```bash

ng  build

```

  

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
